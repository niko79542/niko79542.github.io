    "\n",
    "**Definitions**\n",
    "Review:  A review's is the words of the review, represented as numbers in a numpy array.  The number indicates the frequency of the word in the dataset as a whole.  Smaller numbers are more frequent.\n",

    "**Parameters/features/x_values** Variables we will use to predict the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**: We will have the 'right answers' to the review's sentiment.  Y values will be either 0's or 1's indicating if the review was actually negative or positive respectively.  These discrete output value makes this a classification problem, which is great for logistic regression.\n",
